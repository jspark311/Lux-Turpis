# Lux Turpis ("Light Mixer")

Lux Turpis is an ISM radio relay. The hardware is a one-off multi-platform system
that is mounted to an antenna mast. You can try to replicate it if you like, but
it is being posted more as a demonstration and documentation piece, rather than as
a usable body of code and hardware plans.
